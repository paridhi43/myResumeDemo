    <h2>Hello This is My resume</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Paridhi Nagori</strong>, a third-year Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student with a passion for technology, creativity, and continuous learning. I’m currently diving deep into the world of Full Stack Web Development, focusing on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), and loving every step of the journey.</p>
    My goal is to blend strong coding skills with problem-solving and design thinking to create impactful digital experiences. I'm also exploring Japanese and German language and culture to expand my global perspective and communication skills—an advantage I believe will support my dream of working with international tech teams and pursuing higher studies abroad.
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy working on both frontend and backend projects, and I’m always open  to learning new tools, frameworks, and best practices. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me designing, painting, dancing, or exploring creative outlets that inspire innovation.</p>    
    <p> I'm currently building my technical foundation, expanding my project portfolio, and preparing for opportunities that align with my long-term vision of excelling in the tech industry and studying Computer Science/AI at a top university in Germany.</p>
